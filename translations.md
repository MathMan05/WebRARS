# Translations
the translations are stored in `/src/webpage/translations` in this format.
```json
{
	"@metadata": {
		"authors": [
		],
		"last-updated": "XXXX/XX/XX",
		"locale": "ru",
		"comment":""
	},
}
```

## I want to help translate this
Please go to [https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:JankClient](https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:JankClient) to help translate this project
## What is the format?
It's the same format found [here](https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.i18n#message-file-format), though we are not using jquery, and you might notice some of the strings use markdown, but most do not.

## I want to help correct a translation
Go ahead! We're more than happy to take corrections to translations as well!
